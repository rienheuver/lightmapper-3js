# Lightmapper - Threejs
This mini-repo let's you visualize blender-scenes exporter in GLTF-format.

The movement is very basic: drag to rotate camera, click to move to a new position. The moveable area is defined by an object in your scene called 'Floor'. Export your entire blender scene and put it in `src/models/scene.glb`.

If you need an example file, shoot me a message and I'll send you one.

Then run the following commands in a terminal
- `git clone git@github.com:rienheuver/escaperoom.git`

It should now be running in your browser on localhost:8080
